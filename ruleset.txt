Rule 1: 
Go through each and every rule on high priority.
Don't remediate the code 
Only Return a json with line and Rule No which is  matching 


Example:
input: MOVE 'XXXXXXXXX' TO text-001
output: { "line" : "input: MOVE 'XXXXXXXXX' TO text-001" , "Rule": "Rule 4" }
Apply this for all below Rules

Rule 2:
if DATA is declared with DATA:BEGIN OF XXXX OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE, 
example 1:
Data declared with DATA:BEGIN OF XXXX OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE( XXXX is dynamic variables name )
DATA: BEGIN OF itab OCCURS 0 WITH HEADER LINE,   
matnr TYPE matnr ,           
vbeln TYPE vbeln_d,         
END OF itab.


Rule 3:
IF select * is provided in the input ABAP code like below 
Select * From mara
Into corresponding fields of table imara[].



search for all the fields from the table from which data fetched and only those fields should be get selected 

Select * From mara
Into corresponding fields of table imara[].
example 
Input ABAP code 
Select * From mara
Into corresponding fields of table imara[].

Select * From lips
Into corresponding fields of table ilips[]. 
Loop AT ilips[].
READ TABLE imara with key matnr = ilips-matnr.
itab-mara = imara-matnr
itab-vbeln = itab-vbeln.
APPEND itab[].
ENDLOOP.

Output:
*Select * From mara                                  "Commented By PwA  
*Into corresponding fields of table imara[].
*example 
*Input ABAP code 
*Select * From mara
*Into corresponding fields of table imara[].

*Select * From lips
*Into corresponding fields of table ilips[]. 
*Loop AT ilips[].
*READ TABLE imara with key matnr = ilips-matnr.
*itab-mara = imara-matnr
*itab-vbeln = itab-vbeln.
*APPEND itab[].
*ENDLOOP.

Based on 'Rule 2' imara[] declared as gt_mara

Select matnr From mara                                  "Added By PwA  
Into corresponding fields of table gt_mara.

Select vbeln From lips                                   "Added By PwA
Into corresponding fields of table gt_lips. 
Loop AT gt_lips INTO gs_lips.
READ TABLE mara with key matnr = gt_lips-matnr.
gs_itab-mara = gs_mara-matnr
gs_itab-vbeln = gs_lips-vbeln.
APPEND gs_itab to gt_itab.
ENDLOOP.

Example:
Input: 
Select * From mara
Into corresponding fields of table imara[].

Select * From lips
Into corresponding fields of table ilips[]. 
Loop AT ilips[].
READ TABLE imara with key matnr = ilips-matnr.
itab-mara = imara-matnr
itab-vbeln = itab-vbeln.
APPEND itab[].
ENDLOOP.
output:
*Select * From mara                              "Commented By PwA 
*Into corresponding fields of table imara[].

*Select * From lips                              "Commented By PwA 
*Into corresponding fields of table ilips[]. 
*Loop AT ilips[].
*READ TABLE imara with key matnr = ilips-matnr.
*itab-mara = imara-matnr
*itab-vbeln = itab-vbeln.
*APPEND itab[].
*ENDLOOP.

Select matnr From mara                           "Added By PwA
Into corresponding fields of table gt_mara.

Select vbeln From lips                           "Added By PwA
Into corresponding fields of table gt_lips. 
Loop AT gt_lips INTO gs_lips.                    "Added By PwA
READ TABLE mara with key matnr = gt_lips-matnr.
gs_itab-mara = gs_mara-matnr
gs_itab-vbeln = gs_lips-vbeln.
APPEND gs_itab to gt_itab.
ENDLOOP.


Rule 4:
IF 'MOVE' statement found in code it should be replaced like below
Example:
input: MOVE 'XXXXXXXXX' TO text-001
output: 
*MOVE 'XXXXXXXXX' TO text-001   "Commented By PwA
 text-001 = 'XXXXXXXXX'.        "Added By PwA
input: MOVE ls_mara-matnr TO ls_lips-matnr.
output:
*MOVE ls_mara-matnr TO ls_lips-matnr.
ls_lips-matnr = ls_mara-matnr.
Rule 5:
IF 'REFRESH' statement found in code it should be replaced with 'CLEAR' statement
input: 
REFRESH:X_XXXX.
output: 
*REFRESH:X_XXXX. "Commented By PwA
CLEAR X_XXXX. "Added By PwA
Rule 6:
IF 'PARAMETERS' statement found in code like below 
PARAMETERS: p_vbeln LIKE lips-vbeln.
We should search the table 'lips' in this case and field 'vbeln' to get the data element of that field
output should be:

*PARAMETERS: X_vbeln LIKE lips-vbeln. "Commented By PwA
PARAMETERS: X_vbeln TYPE vbeln_vl.    "Added By PwA

Rule 7A:
IF 'TABLES' statement is found then it should be replaced with work area declaration
Example 1:
input: 
TABLES: lips,mara.
output:
*TABLES: lips,mara.                   "Commented By PwA
DATA gs_lips TYPE lips.               "Added By PwA
DATA gs_mara TYPE mara.               "Added By PwA

Rule 7B: 
This rule is continuation of previous rule 'Rule 7A'.
If 'SELECT-OPTIONS' statement found in code like below 
SELECT-OPTIONS: X_matnr FOR mara-matnr.
We should replace it with mara workare matnr field
example:
input:
SELECT-OPTIONS: X_matnr FOR mara-matnr.
output:
*SELECT-OPTIONS: X_matnr FOR mara-matnr. "Commented By PwA
SELECT-OPTIONS: X_matnr FOR gs_mara-matnr. "Added By PwA

Rule 7C:
After 'Rule 7A'  if Data variables are declared with reference of TABLES declared transform code like below Example 
Example:
input:
TABLES: lips,mara.
DATA lv_ersda TYPE mara-ersda.
DATA lv_vbeln TYPE lips-vbeln.

We should search the table  in this case and field  to get the data element of that field
output should be:
*TABLES: lips,mara.              "Commented By PwA
*DATA lv_ersda TYPE mara-ersda.  "Commented By PwA
*DATA lv_vbeln TYPE lips-vbeln.  "Commented By PwA

DATA lv_ersda TYPE ersda.         "Added By PwA
DATA lv_vbeln TYPE vbeln_vl.        "Added By PwA
